reduce thousands of molecules of wine, reduce to buckets

- sugar
- aroma driven
	fruitiness
		- spectrums of red, dark, dry fruit
	oak
	green (veggieness, green beans, asparagus)
	floral
- palate driven
	- abstraction level

varying degrees of success
- academic world yet successful define

wineries have had marginal success in getting information


analytical tools
- gc mass spec
- hplc

labs
- look at individual compounds
- leave it up to you to determine how important the compound is to taste
- ets labs (http://www.etslabs.com/)


compounds
- understand when in isolation
- however other molecules suppress, modify, accentuate the perception
- need to monitor other molecules
- how do they interrelate with other molecules

- level of success is pretty low in genome map

Australia wine research institute
- metabolomics approach combined with sensory


Cheaper or lower cost effective
- use expert wine panel to be cheaper
- they become advocates of that judge


budweiser people
- american consumer: sweetness and fruitiness most important (over 50% of wine consumed)

complex appreciation for wine
- like complexity and variation, different sorts of things, difficult to reduce number of buckets
- provide consumer information about if you want to try oaky wine try this (transient consumer)

Australian journal of wine research
- reviews of complexity of wine to quantify, provide metrics to wine to relate that to consumer
